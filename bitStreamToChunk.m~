function decStream = bitStreamToChunk(bitStream, bitsPerRow, m, n, numLayers)
bitsPerRow = 8;
sizeDec = m*n*numLayers; 

[bitsPerRow, sizeDec] = size(bitStream);

% grab and make into an 8x length matrix (opposite of before)
bitStreamMat = reshape(bitStream, bitsPerRow, sizeDec)';

% Then, take from binary back to decimal:
decStreamVec = bi2de(bitStreamMat')

% Lastly, throw back into the original image shape:
decStream = reshape(decStreamVec, m,n,numLayers);
