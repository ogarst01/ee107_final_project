function MMSEEqualizer(signal, sigma2, g_t, channel_impulse_resp)

% define energy Eb of pulse for SNR calculation:
Eb = (norm(g_t))^2;

% quick check -> Eb should be 1. 

% calculate SNR given noise power sigma squared(sigma2)
SNR  = sigma2./Eb;

H = fft(downsample(channel_impulse_resp, 31));

Hconj = conj(H);

% calculate the frequency response of the MMSE Equalizer:
HMMSE = Hconj./((abs(H)).^2 + (SNR));

% fine the frequency response using fft method: 
Hf = fft(h_upsample, N_fft);
